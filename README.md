# MadLibs
App 4 for Native App Studio

This app allows the user to fill in 5 different mad libs stories (Simple, Tarzan, University, Clothes & Dance).

Extra's: 
- The filled-in words in the final screen are bold
- In the third screen (screenshot 3 and 6) the type of word that needs to be filled in is always lowercase.
- And the app does not allow the user to parse empty strings into the story
